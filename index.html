            <p>Hello World! My name is Blake Marter. Currently, I am a student but I am much more than that.Among other
              things, I have a passion for golf, video games, and coding.</p>

            <p>I started golfing when I was 4 years old, and have loved it ever since. I've played in many local and
              state-wide tournements in my day, and I absolutely love the sport.</p>

            <p>Video games are another love of mine. I have had most of the consoles growing up, but most recently, I
              have
              delved into the world of Destiny 1&2 and can't seem to stop!</p>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12 ml-3">
              <p>Lastly, I have a passion for coding. Although, I am new to the coding world, I can't seem to get enough
                of it. I still have a lot to learn, but I am eager and willing to take on any challenges that lie ahead.
